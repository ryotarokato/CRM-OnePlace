  <p align="center">
    This is my first self made bigger project that I was working on recently. It is CRM, CRUD app built on: front-end: react, back-end: node.js, express, mysql.
    <br />
    Main purpose of this project is to manage business based on orders that don't need online shop.
    <br />
    For example selling items on livestreams.

<h3>Additional info</h3>
<p>I've styled the whole app with pure CSS by myself</p>
<p>The app was designed to be non-scrollable.</p>
<p>I've decided to not use next.js to improve my node.js skills and learn more about front-end --- back-end synergy</p>
